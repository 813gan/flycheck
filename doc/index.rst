 Flycheck â€” Modern Emacs syntax checking
=========================================

Flycheck is a modern on-the-fly syntax checking extension for GNU Emacs 24.

It uses various syntax checking and linting tools to check the contents of
buffers, and reports warnings and errors directly in the buffer, or in an
optional error list.  The following screenshot shows Flycheck at work in an
Emacs Lisp buffer, with the `Solarized Light`_ theme and the `Source Code Pro`_
font:

   :scale: 75%

It is a replacement for the older Flymake extension, which is part of Emacs,
with more supported languages, more features, and better extensibility:

Features
========
Installation
============

Flycheck needs Emacs 24, and works best on Unix systems (i.e. Linux or OS X).

.. note::

   For almost all supported languages, Flycheck also needs additional
   **external** checker programs.  See :doc:`manual/languages` for a list of
   supported languages and the corresponding checkers programs, and use
   :command:`flycheck-describe-checker` to get help about specific checkers
   inside Emacs.

Install the ELPA package from MELPA_ or Marmalade_ with :kbd:`M-x
package-install RET flycheck`.

In your Cask_ file:

.. code-block:: cl

   (source gnu)
   (source melpa)

   (depends-on "flycheck")

See :ref:`installation` for detailed installation instructions.
