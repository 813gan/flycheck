Installation
============

Flycheck needs Emacs 24, and works best on Unix systems (i.e. Linux or OS X).

Install the ELPA package from MELPA_ or Marmalade_ with :kbd:`M-x
package-install RET flycheck`.

In your Cask_ file:

.. code-block:: cl

   (source gnu)
   (source melpa)

   (depends-on "flycheck")

Most syntax checkers need external utilities.  See :doc:`manual/languages` for
supported languages and utilities, or use :kbd:`C-c ! ?` to see information
about a specific syntax checker.

See :ref:`installation` for detailed installation instructions.
